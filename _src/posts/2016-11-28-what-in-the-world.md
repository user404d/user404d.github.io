_Blogging is fashionable again, so I too will add some noise to the mix._

## Why `blog` at all?

My hope is that this platform will give me the opportunity to show off cool projects
that I work on while refining my writing and communication skills. I am interested in
a wide range of topics in computer science, but tend to stay in the general (and broad)
areas of programming language theory and design, artificial intelligence, and security.
I also plan to make casual posts from time to time to try and regain perspective and
a little sanity.
